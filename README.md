## DentER

### A native mobile app for patients to avoid the ER with dental issues

_Brought to you by WebHealth LakeheadU_

## What is DentER

DentER is a prototype application created to help connect on-call dentists with patients in need of
dental assistance. When provided with an adequate alternative, we believe that such an application
could vastly reduce the number of patients who visit Emergency Rooms for dental problems, unaware
that dental services are not typically provided there.

## Development Tools

The DentER prototype was created using React-Native as a front-end native android/ios development tool,
and AWS services (Mobile Hub, AWS CLI, AWS Amplify, Cognito, DynamoDB). Individually, and as a team,
this was our first time working with React-Native for cross platform native development.
